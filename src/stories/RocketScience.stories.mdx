## 1. Create a new Rocket Science application

This will clone and customize the Rocket Science repository based on the choices made during the CLI prompts after the command is run. 

<br/>

`$ NewRocketScienceApplication`

This will determine the name of not only the parent directory of the application, but also the name provided to the `ModuleFederationPlugin` in the `./webpack.config.js`

<br/>

## 3. Change directories into your newly generated project

`$ cd NewRocketScienceApplication`

<br/>
